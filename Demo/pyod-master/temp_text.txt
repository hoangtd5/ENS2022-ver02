**Note on Python 2.7**\ :
The maintenance of Python 2.7 will be stopped by January 1, 2020 (see `official announcement <https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/344>`_).
To be consistent with the Python change and PyOD's dependent libraries, e.g., scikit-learn, we will
stop supporting Python 2.7 in the near future (dates are still to be decided). We encourage you to use
Python 3.5 or newer for the latest functions and bug fixes. More information can
be found at `Moving to require Python 3 <https://python3statement.org/>`_.

Running examples needs **matplotlib**, which may throw errors in conda
virtual environment on mac OS. See reasons and solutions `mac_matplotlib <https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod/issues/6>`_.
